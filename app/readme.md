Order Logic

Once the order is scheduled, the cards are put on hold.

order status
-> new
(all statuses beyond here, cards are unavailable for)
-> scheduled
-> to be shipped
-> shipped
-> returning
(once the order is complete, cards are available)
-> complete

Once the user sets a schedule, availability is evaluated and order status is set to "scheduled".

The user next goes to the credit card auth form. If authroized, the status is set to "to be shipped".




Admin will log in and see a link to an order management page with a count of unshipped orders. There will be an index and show page for orders of each type Â­ unshipped, shipped, returning, closed.

plug in routes and actions for shipping orders,
admin clicks order shipped,
cards are due back x number of days later plus shipping time
*** need to indicate on orders page when they want their cards and for how long.

*** when admin clicks order shipped, state is updated and email is sent to user

Make heroku scheduler task
-> send email re cards due back soon
-> send email re cards due, click when shipped
** create an anonomyzed token for each order once shipped
** prepare route for updating order and printing a thank you to the user.

-> add deck returned link
